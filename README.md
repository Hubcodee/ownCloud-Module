# ownCloud-Module

## This python modules use ownCloud's provisioning api

`The Provisioning API application enables a set of APIs that external systems can use to:

Create, edit, delete and query user attributes

Query, set and remove groups

Set quota and query total storage used in ownCloud

Group admin users can also query ownCloud and perform the same functions as an admin for groups they manage.

Query for active ownCloud applications, application info, and to enable or disable an app.`
